```
source ~/venv_enjoyalgorithm_projects/bin/activate
```

#### Step 3: Upgrade pip

```
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

#### Step 4: Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/enjoyalgorithms/Machine-learning-project-code.git
```

#### Step 5: Change the directory
```
cd Machine-learning-project-code
```

#### Step 6: Install dependencies

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 7: Open the jupyter-notebook to run these ipynb files 
```
jupyter-notebook
```
